## CTF WriteUps

This repository contains my personal write-ups for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges solved on learning platforms such as TryHackMe and some other in the future.

The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning process, share methodologies used during exploitation, and track my progress in cybersecurity.

- HackTheBox (coming soon)

## Focus Areas
- Service and port enumeration
